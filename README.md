UncleJim ("**Un**modifiable **Coll**ections for **J**avaâ„¢ **Imm**utability") provides type-safe versions of Clojure's immutable collections and a few other tools to make functional programming in Java a little easier.

**Notice:** This project will be renamed to "Paguro" which is short for the Latin "Paguroidea", the name of the Hermit Crab Superfamily in Biology.  These collections grow by adding a new shell, leaving the insides the same, much the way Hermit Crabs trade up to a new shell when they grow.  Plus, hermit crabs are cute.

#Features

* [Immutable collections](src/main/java/org/organicdesign/fp/collections) - type-safe generic Java versions of Clojure's immutable collections - arguably the best immutable collection implementations on the JVM.
* [Functional transformations](src/main/java/org/organicdesign/fp/xform/Transformable.java#L42) are a simplified immutable alternative to Java 8 Streams, wrapping checked exceptions and avoiding primitives (you can still use Java 8 streams if you want to).
* [Brief collection constructors](src/main/java/org/organicdesign/fp/StaticImports.java#L36) are like a tiny, type-safe data definition language:
  * `vec("one", "two", "three")` - an immutable vector/list of three strings
  * `set(3, 5, 7)` - an immutable set of three integers
  * `tup("Alice", 11, 3.14)` - an immutable 3-field tuple or record
  * `map(tup(1, "single"), tup(2, "double"), tup(3, "triple"))` - an immutable map that uses integers to look up appropriate strings.
* [Extensible, immutable tuples](src/main/java/org/organicdesign/fp/tuple) - use them for rapid prototyping, then later extend them to make your own lightweight, immutable Java classes with correct `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` implementations.
* [Lazy initialization](src/main/java/org/organicdesign/fp/LazyRef.java#L5) - LazyRef thread-safely performs initialization and frees initialization resources on first use.  Subsequent uses get the now-constant initialized value.
* [Memoization](src/main/java/org/organicdesign/fp/function/Function3.java#L42) - Turns function calls into hashtable lookups to speed up slow functions over a limited range of inputs.
* Tiny with no dependencies - The entire project fits in a 200K jar file that is compiled in the compact1 profile.

UncleJim takes advantages of Java's type inferencing.  It eschews void return types, arrays, primatives, and checked exceptions in lambdas.  It can decrease the amount of code you need to write by a factor of at 2x-3x.  Using functional transfomrations instead of loops focuses you on choosing the right collections which leads to more readable code AND better Big O complexity/scalability.

#Details



```java
// Define some people with lists of email addresses on the fly.
// vec() makes a Vector/List, tup() makes a Tuple
vec(tup("Jane", "Smith", vec("a@b.c", "b@c.d")),
    tup("Fred", "Tase", vec("c@d.e", "d@e.f", "e@f.g")))

        // We want to look up people by their address.
        // There are multiple addresses per person.
        // For each person, find their email addresses.
        .flatMap(person -> person._3()

        // For each address, produce a key/value pair
        // of email and person (Tuple2 implements Map.Entry)
                                 .map(email -> tup(email, person)))

        // toImMap() collects the results to key/value pairs and puts
        // them in an immutable map.  We already have pairs, so pass
        // them through unchanged.
        .toImMap(x -> x)

        // Look up Jane by her address
        .get("b@c.d")

        // Get her first name (returns "Jane")
        ._1();
```

#Manifesto

* Immutability promotes correct code as much as type safety does.
* Better to focus on picking the appropriate collections and transformations than on looping details.
* Write functions before defining classes, yet still take advantage of type safety.
* On-the fly data definition should be simple and easy.  Naming/formalizing those data structures should be too.
* Minimal, easy-to-understand interface covering the most critical building blocks for higher functionality.

#FAQ

##Q: How does this compare to PCollections?

[UncleJim is based on Clojure, theoretically faster and has additional features](https://github.com/GlenKPeterson/UncleJim/wiki/UncleJim-vs.-PCollections)

##Q: Do these Transforms create intermediate collections between each operation (like the Scala collections)?

[No](https://github.com/GlenKPeterson/UncleJim/wiki/How-do-%22Xforms%22---Transformations-work%3F)

##Q: How does this compare to Streams and lambda expressions in JDK8?
