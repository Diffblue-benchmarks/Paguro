<p>Clojure's immutable collections made type safe, an immutable transformation builder, a data definition language, and other tools for writing functional Java.</p>

Highlights:
<ul>
    <li>Immutable collections from Clojure</li>
    <li>An immutable Transformation Builder which is baked into every collection interface.</li>
    <li>A tiny domain-specific language of brief helper functions: vec(), tup(), map(), set(), and xform()</li>
    <li>Simplified functional interfaces that wrap checked exceptions</li>
</ul>

Also, there are experimental features you may find useful:
<ul>
    <li>Unmodifiable interfaces which deprecate mutator methods and throw exceptions to retrofit legacy code and catch errors in your IDE instead of at runtime.</li>
    <li>An Equator and ComparisonContext which work like `java.util.Comparator`, but for hash-based collections.</li>
    <li>Memoization for functions</li>
</ul>
