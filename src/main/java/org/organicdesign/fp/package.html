<p>A mini data definition language composed of short methods like vec(), tup(), map(), set(), plus xform() which makes java.util collections transformable.</p>
<pre><code>import org.organicdesign.fp.StaticImportsKt.*

// Create a new vector of integers
vec(1, 2, 3, 4);

// Create a new set of Strings
set("a", "b", "c");

// Create a tuple of an int and a string (a type-safe heterogeneous container)
tup("a", 1);

// Create a map with a few key value pairs
map(tup("a", 1),
tup("b", 2),
tup("c", 3));</code></pre>

<p>There are only a few methods in this project to take varargs and they are all in this file.
    Writing out versions that took multiple type-safe arguments caused IntelliJ to present all of them
    for auto-completion which was overwhelming, so I reverted to varargs.  Also,
    varargs relax some type safety rules (variance) for data definition in a generally helpful (rarely
    dangerous) way.</p>

<p>If you're used to Clojure/JSON, you'll find that what's a map (dictionary) in those languages
    sometimes becomes a tuple in Paguro and sometimes becomes a map. A map in a type-safe language is
    homogeneous, meaning that every member is of the same type (or a descendant of a common ancestor).
    Tuples are designed to contain unrelated data types and enforce those types.</p>

<p>As with any usage of import *, there could be issues if you import 2 different versions of this
    file in your classpath, or if a method is ever removed from this file.  Java needs a data
    definition language so badly that I think it is worth this small risk.</p>
