<p>This approximates union types for Java - for when something (e.g. a return type) can be
    exactly one of some number of things.  This is NOT variance or inheritance (Cars and Trucks are Vehicles),
this is one un-related thing or another (a set of things that are either Trucks OR Happiness).</p>

<p>Java has specifically avoided union types in favor of defining a super-type and making those
    other two types extend the new parent.  But sometimes you don't have control of the two types to
    make them inherit from a common ancestor (like Trucks and Happiness).  Sometimes, one hierarchy
    makes sense in one context and another hierarchy makes sense in another.</p>

<p>For example, in the Serialization code for PersistentVector, we use a SerializationProxy to
    handle the actual serialization and deserialization of PersistentVectors.  Our proxy has
    a transient (in the serialization sense) ImList variable.  When serializing, it holds an
    immutable vector.  When deserializing, it holds a MutableVector for speed.  In the context
    of that code, it makes sense to treat the mutable and immutable vector the same.  So the
    Mutable class could subclass the immutable one.</p>

<p>But if a method says it returns an Immutable object, we don't want to get a Mutable one by
    accident.  So that would be the opposite inheritance hierarchy.  Really, we want to move
    to a type system where types are sets so that you can have an ImmutableOrMutable type and
    a OnlyImmutable type and have PersistentVector be one in one circumstance and the other in
    the other circumstance.  ML had this in 1990.  Haskelltook it from there.  Then Object Oriented
    programming took the world by storm and in types without Objects waned.
    In retrospect, we may have missed something.</p>

<p>If you like Paguro and are interested in a new JVM and maybe compile-to-JavaScript language
    with Union and Intersection types instead of Object Oriented hierarchies, take a look at the
    evolving spec for the
    <a href="https://github.com/GlenKPeterson/Cymling" target="_blank">Cymling</a> programming
    language.  It may need some help to become reality.</p>
