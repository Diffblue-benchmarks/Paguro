<p>Type-safe versions of the immutable Clojure collections, plus unmodifiable and immutable
    collection interfaces that extend the java.util collections, deprecating the mutate-in-place
    methods (Unmod____) and adding methods that return a new, immutable, modified version of the
    collection (Im____).</p>

<h3>Definitions</h3>
<dl>
    <dt>Mutable</dt>
    <dd>This describes the mutate-in-place philosophy of the java.util collections.&#160;
        This was sensible when they were created in the 1990's when memory was expensive, the
        garbage collector was in its infancy, and multi-processor systems were rare.&#160;
        Today, memory is cheap, the garbage collector is one of the wonders of the modern world,
        and even your phone has several processors.&#160;
        But we still need to extend these interfaces for backward compatibility.</dd>

    <dt>Unmodifiable</dt>
    <dd>This is similar to what the Collections.unmodifiableXxxx() methods return.&#160;
        The "Unmod-" interfaces in this package extend the java.util mutable collections, but deprecate all
        mutate-in-place methods and throw UnsupportedOperationExceptions when those methods are called.&#160;
        These interfaces also provide an extension point for making new Immutable interfaces and collections.&#160;
        In general, the "Unmod-" interfaces do not add functionality, except UnmodIterable adds transformation to all collections and UnmodMap adds Iterable&lt;Map.Entry&gt; to Map.</dd>

    <dt>Immutable</dt>
    <dd>This is what the Clojure collections provide.&#160;
        The collection itself cannot be changed, yet it has "modification" methods that return a new immutable collection reflecting the change
        while still sharing as much data as possible with the original collection so that these methods are relatively fast and lightweight.</dd>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>We want to make it as easy as possible to live in an immutable world while working with existing Java code.&#160;
    In a perfect world, all the Java APIs and existing code would be magically rewritten to use Immutable (according to the above definition) collections.</p>

    <p>This package contains Unmodifiable "Unmod" interfaces which override, deprecate, and implement each of the "set" methods in the java.util collections interfaces.&#160;
    They also provide built-in Transformations (inherited from UnmodIterable).
    Each of the "Unmod" collection interfaces are eventually extended by "Im" interfaces which represent "Immutable" collections.&#160;
    The Immutable interfaces further provide new alternative "set" methods which return the altered collection, as well as some convenience methods.&#160;
    Finally, there are various implementations of the Immutable interfaces.&#160;
    Most of those implementations (beginning with Persistent___) are derivative works of the source code for Clojure.</p>
