<p>Makes immutable collections (like/from Clojure) work with the existing java.util collections.</p>
<h3>Definitions</h3>
<dl>
    <dt>Mutable</dt>
    <dd>This is a reasonable term for the java.util collections.&#160;
        Really, they are built on an assumption that you will modify them in-place, never making any copies.&#160;
        This was sensible when they were created in the 1990's when memory was expensive, the
        garbage collector was in it's infancy, and multi-processor systems were rare.&#160;
        But today, memory is cheap, the garbage collector is one of the wonders of the modern world, and even your phone has several processors.&#160;
        We have to extend these interfaces for compatibility, but the sub-interfaces both throw UnsupportedOperationException and deprecate the modification
        methods so that your IDE and the compiler give you warnings when you try to use the wrong method.</dd>

    <dt>Unmodifiable</dt>
    <dd>This is what the Collections.unmodifiableXxxx() methods return.&#160;
        They implement the Mutable interfaces, but throw an UnsupportedOperationException when a mutation method is called.&#160;
        It is a shame that the java.util mutable collection interfaces are not extended from Unmodifiable
        interfaces having the same "get" methods (readers), but without any "set" methods (modifiers).&#160;
        It would be useful for a function to accept Unmodifiable interfaces in order to say,
        "I'm not going to modify this" and return Unmodifiable interfaces to say, "You can't modify this."&#160;
        Since that's not possible, this package provides the next-best thing which is "Un" interfaces which extend the java.util mutable collections.</dd>

    <dt>Immutable</dt>
    <dd>This is what the Clojure collections provide.&#160;
        The collection itself cannot be changed, yet it has "modification" methods that return a new immutable collection reflecting the change
        while still sharing as much data as possible with the original collection so that these methods are relatively fast and lightweight.&#160;
        For this to work, each "set" method needs to return a new collection.&#160;
        Unfortunately, the java.util mutable collections "set" methods all return something else, like a boolean indicating success,
        or the item you just inserted.&#160;
        This package works around that limitation.</dd>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>In a perfect world, all the Java APIs and existing code would be magically rewritten to use Immutable collections.&#160;
    Next best would be if java.util would have unmodifiable collections interfaces (UnCollection, UnList, UnSet, UnMap..) at the top of the interface hierarchy.&#160;
    Those interfaces would have only "get" methods (no "set" methods).&#160;
    Each of the current java.util collection interfaces would extend the "Un" interfaces to add the "set" methods which could remain unchanged for backwards compatibility.&#160;
    Immutable "Im" interfaces could then extend the "Un" interfaces without any deprecations or UnsupportedOperationExceptions.</p>

<p>We don't have the perfect hierarchy, but we still want to make it as easy as possible to work with existing Java code.&#160;
    This package contains Unmodifiable "Un" interfaces which override, deprecate, and implement each of the "set" methods in the java.util collections interfaces.&#160;
    Each of the "Un" collection interfaces is then extended by an "Im" interface which represents an "Immutable" collection.&#160;
    The Immutable interfaces further provide new alternative "set" methods which return the "altered" collection, as well as some convenience methods.&#160;
    Finally, there are various implementations of the Immutable interfaces (currently, they are all copied from Clojure).</p>
