<p>Some ideas for runtime types.  This is fairly experimental and could change.
    Feedback would be appreciated.
    I'm considering storing types in Class[] for performance but everyone has to trust everyone else
never to modify one of those arrays.  I ended up using ImList instead so that no trust is needed.</p>
